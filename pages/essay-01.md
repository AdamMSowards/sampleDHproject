# History Will End

## Introduction

History has a beginning, of course. But does it end? If so, what does that look like? 

These are questions perhaps better suited to a philosopher than to a historian. Yet, historians might benefit from pondering such ponderous thoughts. 

I *suspect* I am correct but am uncommitted to the idea of history being unending, rather **unendable**. I hope it is clear that I'm not discussing ["The End of History"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24027184) nonsense promulgated by Francis Fukuyama concerning the Cold War's end. Today, more pressing concerns reign over geopolitics of a bipolar world.

1. Anthropogenic Climate Change
2. Rising Global Income Inequality
3. Inequality *within* Nations, economic and political

That just gets us started.

Leave an empty line between headings and paragraphs.

Font can be *Italic* or **Bold**.

Citing your work is important! [^1]

Title sections of your essay with headings, by adding a pound sign (`#`) in front of the title:

# Heading One

## Heading Two

### Heading Three, etc.

Hyperlinks look like this [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/).

A bullet list is created using `*`, `+`, or `-`, like:

- dog
- cat
- muffin

A numbered list is created using a number + `.`, like:

1. one
2. two
6. three
2. four

A horizontal line break can be useful for separating content:
