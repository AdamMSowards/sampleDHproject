# History Will End

{% include feature/line-chart.html data="party-platforms-1900-1944-republican" topic="government power" %}
This topic, which I labled "government power," rises during a period of conservative Republican rule. Conservatism in the 1920s eschewed power and government growth.[^1] This juxtaposition, then, is counterintuitive. Either I labeled it wrong (a likely occurrence), or there is something about our traditional understanding of Republican governance that demands more attention. 

## Introduction

History has a beginning, of course. But does it end? If so, what does that look like? 

These are questions perhaps better suited to a philosopher than to a historian. Yet, historians might benefit from pondering such ponderous thoughts. 

I *suspect* I am correct but am uncommitted to the idea of history being unending, rather **unendable**. I hope it is clear that I'm not discussing ["The End of History"](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24027184) nonsense promulgated by Francis Fukuyama concerning the Cold War's end. Today, more pressing concerns reign over geopolitics of a bipolar world.

1. Anthropogenic Climate Change
2. Rising Global Income Inequality
3. Inequality *within* Nations, economic and political

That just gets us started.
